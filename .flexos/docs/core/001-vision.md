# Vision & Strategy for Blanky-App

This document outlines the foundational product and business strategy for Blanky-App. It serves as the north star for all development, design, and marketing efforts.

## 1. Vision

**To empower every small business and entrepreneur to build the custom software they need, without needing to hire a developer or write a single line of code.**

We envision a world where creating a web application is as simple as creating a slide deck. Technology should be an enabler, not a barrier. Blanky-App will be the go-to platform for building simple, powerful, and beautiful internal tools, customer portals, and public-facing web apps.

## 2. Mission

**Our mission is to provide an intuitive, flexible, and affordable no-code platform that enables non-technical users to build and deploy fully functional web applications in hours, not months.**

We will achieve this by focusing on three core pillars:
1.  **Simplicity:** A clean, drag-and-drop interface with pre-built components that are easy to understand and configure.
2.  **Power:** A robust backend that handles data management, user authentication, and business logic without user intervention.
3.  **Speed:** A seamless development and deployment process that allows users to go from idea to live application instantly.

## 3. Strategy

Our go-to-market strategy is a phased approach, focusing on establishing a strong foundation before expanding.

*   **Phase 1: Beachhead Market (MVP)**: We will initially target service-based small businesses (e.g., landscapers, consultants, cleaning services). Their needs are often straightforward: client management (simple CRM), job scheduling, and invoicing. Our MVP, as detailed in the [Features Document](./002-features.md), will be laser-focused on providing the tools to build these specific applications.
*   **Phase 2: Expansion (Fast Follow)**: After validating the core product, we will expand our component library and add key integrations (e.g., Stripe, Zapier, Google Sheets). This will broaden our appeal to a wider range of small businesses, including marketing teams and startups needing to build internal dashboards or simple customer-facing portals.
*   **Phase 3: Platform & Ecosystem (Long-Term)**: Our long-term goal is to build an ecosystem around Blanky-App. This includes introducing an app template marketplace, enabling team collaboration features, and potentially opening a component marketplace for third-party developers to contribute to.

## 4. User Personas

We are building for three primary user personas:

*   **Sam the Service Pro (Primary Persona)**
    *   **Bio:** Owner of a small landscaping company with 5 employees. Spends too much time managing clients and schedules on spreadsheets and paper.
    *   **Goals:** Wants a simple app to track customers, schedule jobs, and send invoices from his phone or tablet. Needs it to be incredibly easy to set up and use.
    *   **Frustrations:** Off-the-shelf software is either too expensive or too complicated. Custom development is out of the question.

*   **Maria the Marketer (Secondary Persona)**
    *   **Bio:** Marketing manager at a 50-person tech company. Frequently needs to create landing pages for campaigns and internal dashboards to track leads.
    *   **Goals:** Wants to quickly build and launch marketing assets without relying on the engineering team's limited bandwidth.
    *   **Frustrations:** The development cycle for simple requests is too long, causing her to miss opportunities.

*   **Devin the Developer (Tertiary Persona)**
    *   **Bio:** A freelance web developer who builds applications for various clients.
    *   **Goals:** Wants a tool to rapidly prototype ideas and build simple MVPs for clients to validate concepts before committing to a full custom build.
    *   **Frustrations:** Setting up a full stack (auth, database, deployment) for a simple project is time-consuming and repetitive.

## 5. Success Metrics

We will measure our success against these key performance indicators (KPIs):

*   **Activation Rate:** Percentage of new signups who publish their first app within 7 days.
*   **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Number of users logging in and actively building/managing apps.
*   **Number of Published Apps:** The total count of live applications built on our platform.
*   **Time-to-First-App (TTFA):** The median time it takes for a new user to go from signup to publishing their first app. Our goal is under 60 minutes.
*   **Customer Churn Rate:** The percentage of paid subscribers who cancel their subscription each month.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** A measure of user satisfaction and loyalty.
