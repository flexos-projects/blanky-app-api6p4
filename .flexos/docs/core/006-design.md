# Design System & Brand Guidelines

This document establishes the visual and tonal identity for Blanky-App. A consistent design system ensures a cohesive user experience, accelerates development, and strengthens our brand. It should be used for all marketing materials and within the product itself.

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

Our voice is **empowering, simple, and encouraging**. We want users to feel capable and confident. We are a helpful guide, not a technical manual.

-   **Empowering:** Use active language.
